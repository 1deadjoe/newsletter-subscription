## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

I have learned how to handle forms and form validation using Javascript. I have also learned how to change a HTML element's class using JS. Took me longer, but I'm on my way to mastery.

### Continued development

I plan on learning more of JS to imlement in my web design. I also tend to learn how to write more reusable code for my websites.
